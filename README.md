# PicToShare

A basic Photo sharing platform.
User can share photos and also view photos shared by other user .
Profile settings is included.
* Instead of Email Password sign-in a better option Google Sign-In is used so the user does not have to remember the password .*
User can view photos but can only share if Phone no. is verified.
Simple User schema is implemented on cloud firestore.
Stream Builder is used to fetch updated photos list.
Bottom Navigation is fully working but haven't set any other widgets.
